## Installation

Navigate to the root directory of your Hugo site and clone this repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/kimcc/hugo-theme-noteworthy.git themes/noteworthy
```

Refer to the [Hugo docs](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) for more information.

## Image shortcode for large images

To add images using the resize-image shortcode included with this theme, you will need to create a [Post Bundle](https://gohugo.io/content-management/organization/#page-bundles). Create a folder for your post, put your Markdown file and images inside, and rename your Markdown file `index.md`. For example: 

```
my-new-post
- index.md
- image1.jpg
- image2.png
```

Then, you can add an image within your Markdown file by using the shortcode like this:

```
{{< resize-image src="image1.jpg" alt="My first image" >}}
```

Add captions like this: 

```
{{< resize-image src="image2.png" alt="My second image" caption="My caption" >}}
```

## Read more link for posts

Set `showReadMore = false` to `true` in the config file to have a "read more" link show up when posts are truncated.

## Social media accounts

In the `params` section of the `config.toml` file, you can add links to your social media accounts. Simply remove the ones that you don't want to include, and their icons will disappear from the site.

```
# Main
email = "#"
facebook = "#"
twitter = "#"
instagram = "#"
tumblr = "#"
reddit = "#"
pinterest = "#"
youtube = "#"
vimeo = "#"
weibo = "#"
vk = "#"
linkedin = "#"

# Writing
medium = "#"
blogger = "#"
wordpress = "#"

# Creative & Visual
dribbble = "#"
behance = "#"
deviantart = "#"
flickr = "#"

# Audio & Music
soundcloud = "#"

# Programming
github = "#"
stackoverflow = "#"
gitlab = "#"
codepen = "#"

# Academic
googlescholar = "#"
impactstory = "#"
orcid = "#"  
```


## Disqus and Google Analytics

Add your Disqus shortname and Google Analytics identifier in the `config.toml` file.

```
# Add your Disqus shortname here.
disqusShortname = ""      

# Add your Google Analytics identifier: UA-XXXXXXXX-X
googleAnalytics = "" 
```

## Use an RSS icon

By default, Noteworthy will display an RSS feed link in text in the navigation menu. You may configure your site to instead include the RSS feed link as an icon in the social icons by setting `rssicon` to true in the `params` section of the `config.toml` file.

```
rssicon = true
```

## Ko-fi donation button

If you'd like to enable a Ko-fi button on your posts, enable it in the config file and add your identifier.

```
# Set enableKofi to true to enable the Ko-fi support button. Add your Ko-fi ID to link to your account.
enableKofi = true
kofi = ""
```
